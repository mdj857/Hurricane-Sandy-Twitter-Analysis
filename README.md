## Motivation

The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most active hurricane seasons in over a decade. Not since the mid-2000s had the Atlantic churned out hurricanes with such frequency and intensity. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria ravaged through large swaths of the southeast United States and Puerto Rico, causing significant spikes in buzz on Twitter in the process. The presence of a vast wealth of textual and geographical information available on Twitter coupled with the spikes in social media buzz during the events provided the basis for a very fundamental question: given a tweet from the areas affected during Hurricane Sandy, is it possible to predict the level of damage for that specific area?
