# 1. Motivation

We started this project because. 

To answer our question, we turned our attention to one of the most significant meteorological events in recent memory: Hurricane Sandy. 

As it turns out, there was no lack of Twitter about Hurricane Sandy. For our project, we analyzed 37 publicly available tweets with the hashtag “#sandy” or containing some other keyword deemed relevant to the storm and its aftermath [1]. 

For our damage analysis, we used data from FEMA’s post-disaster survey of 300,000 affected buildings in the tri-state area [2]. As part of their survey, FEMA labeled buildings as affected, minor damage, major damage, or destroyed. A summary of our datasets and the damage classification rule is shown below.
